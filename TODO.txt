         
Minor improvements:
    - update F.A.Q. and instructions page
    - (xenoblight+) Add "Equipment" table
    - (Argon) Multiple teams in LE planner  https://discord.com/channels/1146809197023997972/1146809197023997975/1178673694869049445
 
Ideas: 

- (Vexen) Adding to the "limit the rank in goals according to rarity" idea- marking in red (or something of the sort) if a goal you set is either out of the character's rarity or if it requires an upgrade you have no mission to farm it at yet.

- (Tani) for inventory - for larger pulls of resources some QOL would be nice
         Either a grid of all images to quick reference
         Or a way to search multiple items at once
         
         If you could search multiple, and you pulled a large resource box it would be quite quick to go through and update your inventory

- (Tornagides) Is it possible to have an estimate of the experience that is necessary to gain when you move up in rank?
     Let me explain: when you upgrade to silver 3, for example, you know that you have to be at least level 32, or 94200xp. if we start from silver 1, we could have to calculate the experience gain to do.

- (BaNe) Also it came to my mind that you could also add feature to track your gol on ascension with shards farmable from the nodes

- (saTchymoto) Calculate how many badges to upgrade skill

- (SergeDavid) I wonder if you can bring up a list for characters with ALL active tracks. So combine all their tracks across all LREs to better plan dynamically. 

- (SergeDavid) How many accounts use the app, what is the average hero level, what's the favorite hero teams per LRE track, etc. With the data a lot of cool data can be shown.

- (Somberlord) Evolution idea : being able to share your roster with people. Unique, or generated link that bring to a static page similar to "Who you Own"

- (Catch) it would be useful to build multiple teams per track. 
    In the Vitruvius LE for example I'm planning to use a team for the first few levels and then change to different teams for the higher levels. 
    It would be great if I could pick out and save these ahead of time so that I could easily see how I'm going to progress.
 
 - improvements for legendary event progress (TBD)
   - store Kill points, High Score and Defeat all enemies as separate properties with `number` values   
   - store other restrictions as boolean array
   - add Slider with input for Kill Points and High Score
   - create a new model to store LE progress data or even all LE data
   
   
   - Add server side backup
       - 2 new columns in the Table: LastBackupDate, BackupData
       - new POST,GET UserBackupData to save/retrieve backup data (LastBackupDate) is updated when new data is saved
       - include LastBackupDate in GET UserData
       - add 2 new option to user's menu (Restore Backup/ Create Backup)
           - Restore Backup - GET UserBackupData and update UI with backup data
           - Create Backup - POST UserBackupData get current state and store as user backup in server
       - add reminder to back up data every 7 days
           - save "nextReminderDate" in local storage and compare with LastBackupDate from server response
