         
Minor improvements:
    - update F.A.Q. and instructions page
    - (xenoblight+) Add "Equipment" table
    - (Argon) Multiple teams in LE planner  https://discord.com/channels/1146809197023997972/1146809197023997975/1178673694869049445
 
Ideas: 

- (SergeDavid) How many accounts use the app, what is the average hero level, what's the favorite hero teams per LRE track, etc. With the data a lot of cool data can be shown.

- (Somberlord) Evolution idea : being able to share your roster with people. Unique, or generated link that bring to a static page similar to "Who you Own"

- (Catch) it would be useful to build multiple teams per track. 
    In the Vitruvius LE for example I'm planning to use a team for the first few levels and then change to different teams for the higher levels. 
    It would be great if I could pick out and save these ahead of time so that I could easily see how I'm going to progress.
